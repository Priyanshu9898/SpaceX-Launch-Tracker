## Features
    1. Filterable Launches: Users can apply filters to the launch data based on launch year, launch success, and landing success.

    2. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive and provides a seamless experience on devices of all sizes.

    3. Performance Optimized: The application follows best practices for web performance, SEO, and accessibility, ensuring a fast, accessible, and user-friendly experience.

    4. Technologies Used: The application is built using React and Bootstrap, and uses Axios for API calls. Backend is Buit using Nodejs and Expressjs.
## Technologies Used
- React
- React-bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Nodejs
- Expressjs


## Installation
    To install and run the Contact Management App locally, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x.x or higher recommended)
- npm (v6.x.x or higher recommended)

## Installation

    1. Clone the repository
    
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu9898/SpaceX-Launch-Tracker.git

```

    2. Install dependencies 
```bash
  cd SpaceX-Launch-Tracker
  npm install
```


    3. Start the frontend development server
```bash
  cd frontend
  npm start
```
    4. Start the backend development server
```bash
  cd backend
  npm run dev
```

    This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## Building for production
    To create a production build, run:

```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run build
```

    This will build the app for production and output the files to the build folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes for efficient caching.


## Future Improvements
    1. Add more filters to allow users to search for specific launches.
    2. Provide more details about each launch, such as the launch vehicle used, crew members, etc.
    3. Implement a 'Favorites' feature that allows users to save their favorite launches.
